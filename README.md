### android-libs

Fake system library stub generator as used by [AVP](https://github.com/archos-sa/aos-AVP).

It is usefull for linking and accessing non public system libraries, mostly for pre 5 Android versions.
It won't work from Android 7 since now the linker actively forbids to load non public system libraries.
