Android lib dependencies:

Generate fake android dynamic libraries (only function symbols). Used to get
android dependencies during build process. True android libs will be linked
with libs from device (/system/lib/*so).

HOW TO:
add "include $(BUILD_ANDROID_LIBS)" after setting LOCAL_MODULE
add "LOCAL_LDLIBS += -L$(TARGET_OUT)"
